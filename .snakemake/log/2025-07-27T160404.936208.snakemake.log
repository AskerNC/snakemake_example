MissingOutputException in rule all in file "C:\Users\hms467\github\snakemake_example\Snakefile", line 15:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
report.html (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Removing output files of failed job all since they might be corrupted:
dag.pdf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look below for error messages
